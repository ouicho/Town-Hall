# Town-Hall
Ideas and proposals for Town Hall app
Name: Town Hall- A voting discussion platform for localities

Purpose: Agenda propositioning, and  voting delegation.
This is will allow for localities and neighborhoods to create a form of represention on the network to present issues that are in demand or that brought to attention. Issues would then be voted on and prioritized according to members of the network. Different members would then be able according to Rank and skill set present proposals and offer solutions. Solutions would be voted on, delegated and then implemented. Tokens would be issued to create funding for active campaigns and the workable solutions. 

Description
There are moments when it take a lot more effort to get simple solutions done in a block area of a city. It is hard to organize tenants in an apartment complex over issues such as recycling efforts, temperture control, clean areas of traffic, parking issues, and so forth.
This would create a forum where small communities can present issues that need to be addressed and taken care of that need immediate to emerging solutions. Voting would ranks priorities of issues, where then solutions can be presented and voted on. When solutions are finalized during a specified time range- funding? need? , capacity and skill set would be delegated to members or outsourced. If issues need to presented to localites or local representative necessary contacts would be presented and delegated. 
Another option would also allow neighborhood businesses to crsate incentives with tokens and sales, showing affilation and community fostership. They however would not be however be a part of the voting process, but owners as individuals can make offers/presentations. 

Posting and Listing
A daily listing would head with a to 5 to do list of ítems that need to be addressed in the community. A time stamp next to it would show when it was presented and where it is in the process of being address (voted on as an issue) or delegated (if decided as an issue, has it created funding or recieved funding)  and if someone is managing the issue or if it has been outsourced (someone outside of the community now is handling it or necessary local contacts were made to handle the issue)

Ranking
If issues have been resolved, a solution board would attach selfies of issues taken care or other forms of solution management (reciepts of purchases for community ítems, etc). Likeable features and comment sections would then rank members that managed the issues in the community and expand skill sets of delegation.
Conclusion
This is definitely a work in progress, but once a prototype can be engage this mobile form addressing issues is one’s neighbor Hood, living complex, apartment complex, or other locality can definite aid in connecting individuals to work toward common goals.
